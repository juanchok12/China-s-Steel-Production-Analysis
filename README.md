# China-s-Steel-Production-Analysis-for-Blog
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code that allowed me to convert data from an Excel file into feasible Plotly graphs.  The data was acquired from the World Steel Association through a direct information request. The original Excel data had to be cleaned, converted into tables, and graphed in Excel to develop the stream graph (image document).

The development of the steel industry is one of the biggest indicators of industrial and economic advancement in any form of society. The development of the
the steel industry in particular, metaphorically speaking, is to the likes of the development of bone structures in vertebrate organisms. Both are the product 
of material conditions that allow the society/organism to invest in the production of specific resources that can be reorganized, structured, transported and 
edified into strutures for integral functioning of the whole corpus. 

The production of steel requires a variety of resources and technologies, including iron ore, coal, and advanced manufacturing processes. Similarly, the growth 
of bone structures in vertebrates requires the consumption of nutrients, such as calcium and phosphorus, as well as the activation of specific genes and signaling 
pathways. The product of this study indicates that, when talking at least about raw steel production, China appears to be a different type of organism that the
rest of the capitalist world.
